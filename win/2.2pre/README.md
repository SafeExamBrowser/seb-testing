**SEB 2.2 Preview Version**

Here you can find the current preview build of the next major release of SEB for Windows. Preview builds don't include all the functionality of the final version, they are not tested thoroughly and they are not intended for productive use. You can support us by testing the preview version and give feedback in our forum or by creating an issue here on our GitHub page. 

New in SEB 2.2:
- Additional resources on root level display an icon in the task bar
- Added browser window suffix setting (Browser tab)
- Added confirm quit link setting (Exam tab)
- Replaced the deprecated Mozilla XULRunner browser engine by a full Firefox browser (which is nevertheless running in the same mode with reduced functionality).
- Refactored seb2 XUL browser app.
- Support for additional resources, which can be external (defined by a URL) or embedded into the SEB config file. An embedded resource can be one file or a whole directory with subdirectories, which can either be opened and displayed by the SEB browser or one of the permitted applications.
- SEB can load one of the embedded resources instead of an "Start URL". With this feature pure offline exams can be done if using an offline exam player (for example a HTLM5 exam app).
- Added a page loading (network activity) indicator.
- Added a browser window toolbar, similar to SEB for Mac OS X.

Fixed bugs:
- Updating an existing SEB version should work now.
- Fixed various seb2 bugs
- Favicons for external additional resources are now loaded in the
config tool.
- The desktop background picture is now also removed on PCs running Windows 7.
- If SEB cannot terminate or force quit prohibited applications (Config Tool / Applications / Prohibited Processes) because they are running with other user permissions, then the exam is blocked and SEB asks to enter the quit/restart password (which exam supervisors/supporters should know) to continue.

Known limitations:
- The seb:// and sebs:// URL protocols are not yet registred in the system in this preview version build. 
- This build does not yet automatically generate URL filter rules when external additional resources are added. Activate URL filtering and create filter rules manually.
